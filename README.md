# Task 1
Used work manager to handle background task as it is recommended by Google and it provides better performance and customisation as per requirement than using download manager.
And used broadcast receiver to update download progression in the ui.

Task 1 is not fully functional it's downloads file perfectly but the notification showing conditions are not functional.

Note: if file not statrts downloaded then try change the file url
